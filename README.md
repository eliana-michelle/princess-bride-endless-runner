PRINCESS BRIDE - ESCAPE THE FIRE SWAMP

If you ever watched the fire swamp scene in Princess Bride and thought, wow I wish that could be me, now is your chance!

Help Westley & Buttercup avoid the terrors of the fire swamp in this endless runner game modeled after the iconic 1980s film, The Princess Bride.

Using the SPACEBAR, jump over the fire spurts when they appear in your path.

NEXT STEPS:

1) Add lightning sand obstacle (same rules as flame spurts)
2) Add ROUS obstacle (appears after score is reached -- stab to clear)
3) Add parabolic equation/gravity to jump (make it look cleaner)
4) Have obstacles appear at random intervals
