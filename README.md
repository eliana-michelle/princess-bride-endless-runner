PRINCESS BRIDE - ESCAPE THE FIRE SWAMP

If you ever watched the fire swamp scene in Princess Bride and thought, wow I wish that could be me, now is your chance!

Help Westley & Buttercup avoid the terrors of the fire swamp in this endless runner game modeled after the iconic 1980s film, The Princess Bride.

Using the <spacebar>, jump over the fire spurts when they appear in your path.


NEXT STEPS:

1) Add lightning sand obstacle (appears like fire spurts -- jump over to clear)
2) Add ROUS obstacle (appears after certain amount of game time has elapsed -- stab to clear)
3) Add parabolic equation/gravity to jump (make it look cleaner)
4) Have obstacles appear at random intervals
